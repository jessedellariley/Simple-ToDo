## Notes

Challenges encountered while building the app:

* I didn't realize at first that the onClickListener for items in the recycler view needs to be in TaskItemAdapter rather than just defined in MainActivity, but this helped me understand the purpose of the TaskItemAdapter better. I now understand that the TaskItemAdapter is specifically for anything that needs to access a particular item in the recycler view.
* Once I had switched from using startActivity() to using startActivityForResult() to open the editing feature, I had difficulty figuring out onActivityResult(). I didn't realize that onActivityResult() runs automatically once startActivityForResult() finishes, so I spent some time trying to figure out how to call onActivityResult() manually in my onClickListener definition. In particular, I thought it had to be called there so that I could acess the position of the item that was clicked in the recycler view. But I realized that I could just pass the position as an extra and let onActivityResult() run manually.
* When I clicked an item in the recycler view to try to edit it, nothing would visibly happen at first. This was because I was trying to set onSubmit() of the editing activity to call finish() when the update button was pressed, but I was doing this by passing the button as a View parameter to onSubmit(), and I wasn't doing anything with the View in the function. The solution I came up with was to set an onClickListener for the update button in onCreate() that would call onSubmit() within it.
